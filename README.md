## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to do all the work.

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/devxhubcom/cookiecutter-devxhub

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

**Warning**: After this point, change 'DEVxHUB AIS Team', 'devxhub', etc to your own information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired [options](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project-generation-options.html). For example:

    Cloning into 'cookiecutter-django'...
    remote: Counting objects: 550, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (310/310), done.
    remote: Total 550 (delta 283), reused 479 (delta 222)
    Receiving objects: 100% (550/550), 127.66 KiB | 58 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (283/283), done.

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:pydanny/redditclone.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?

## For Readers of Two Scoops of Django

You may notice that some elements of this project do not exactly match what we describe in chapter 3. The reason for that is this project, amongst other things, serves as a test bed for trying out new ideas and concepts. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but the end result is that it won't necessarily match precisely what is described in the book I co-authored.
