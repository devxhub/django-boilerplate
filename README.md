- Environment variables for configuration (This won't work with Apache/mod_wsgi).

## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then edit the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get [dxh-py](https://github.com/devxhub/dxh-py) to do all the work.

First, get `dxh-py`. Trust me, it's awesome:

```sh
pip install dxh-py
```
Now run it against this repo:

```sh
dxh_py https://github.com/devxhub/django-boilerplate
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

**Warning**: After this point, change 'DEVxHUB', 'devxhub@example.com', etc to your information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired. For example:

```sh
    You've downloaded /home/django-boilerplate before. Is it okay to delete and re-download it? [y/n] (y): y

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?

## Creating Your First Django App

After setting up your environment, you’re ready to add your first app. This project uses the setup from “Two Scoops of Django” with a two-tier layout:

- Top Level Repository Root has config files, documentation, manage.py, and more.

- Second Level Django Project Root is where your Django apps live.

- Second Level Configuration Root holds settings and URL configurations.

The project layout looks something like this:

    <repository_root>/
    ├── config/
    │   ├── settings/
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── base.py
    │   │   ├── local.py
    │   │   └── production.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    ├── <django_project_root>/
    │   ├── <name_of_the_app>/
    │   │   ├── migrations/
    │   │   ├── admin.py
    │   │   ├── apps.py
    │   │   ├── models.py
    │   │   ├── tests.py
    │   │   └── views.py
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── ...
    ├── requirements/
    │   ├── base.txt
    │   ├── local.txt
    │   └── production.txt
    ├── manage.py
    ├── README.md
    └── ...

Following this structured approach, here’s how to add a new app:

1. Create the app using Django’s `startapp` command, replacing `<name-of-the-app>` with your desired app name:

```sh
python manage.py startapp <name-of-the-app>
```

2. Move the app to the Django Project Root, maintaining the project’s two-tier structure:

```sh 
mv <name-of-the-app> <django_project_root>/
```
3. Edit the app’s `apps.py` change name = `'<name-of-the-app>'` to name = `'<django_project_root>.<name-of-the-app>'`.

4. Register the new app by adding it to the `LOCAL_APPS` list in `config/settings/base.py`, integrating it as an official component of your project.

## "Your Stuff"

Scattered throughout the Python and HTML of this project are places marked with "your stuff". This is where third-party libraries are to be integrated with your project.
